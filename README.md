GET http://localhost:8080/search/test | returns search results
=======
npm install

npm hardhat node

copy your first address to your wallet and your private address copy it to your .secret

Create a .secret with your Private address

Create a .infuraid with your infura id

run the script with npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

now with the node running on one terminal, open another and npm run dev

There you go :)

Our search engine needs many API keys but you can still surf the front end no probs :)

Soon we will be updating to Golang and search the web at full speed!
